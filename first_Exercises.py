#Write a program that calculates the square of the sum of two values (a+b)2.
#a = 2, and b = 3.
a = 2
b = 3
square_of_sum = (a+b) * 2
print("The square of two vaules equals:", square_of_sum)

#second exercise
#Write a program that calculates the value of 'y' in an equation y=4ax
#a = 4, and x = 6
a = 4
x = 6
y_value = 4 * a * x
print("The value of y equals:", y_values)
