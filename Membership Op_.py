#MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS
#the membership operators in python are "in" and "not in"
testing_member = "Josh"
list_of_members = ["Adam", "John", "Marie"]
print(testing_member in list_of_members)
#false bc Josh is not a member

#MODULAR OPERATOR
print(4 % 3)
#bc 4 -3 *1 = 1

#COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
#are one step ahead of the assignment operator
#in addition to assigning a value to a variable,
#they can also perform the calculation with the same variable:
# "+=", "-+", "*+", and "/="
#code examples
#+=
val = 5
val +=1     #val = val + 1 (so 5+1)

#-=

#*=
val = 2
val *= 3 #2*3= 6
print(val)
# /=
